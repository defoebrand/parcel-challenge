> This project is a Rails based app built as an interview challenge project. Its intention is to maintain up-to-date data using a given resource and manipulate the received data into human readable formats for viewing online or in print.

# Parcel Challenge

## Project Description

The challenge was to synchronize a JSON object from an external source on a nightly basis and display this data to the User. In order to do so, a database must be established to allow the User to view it asynchronously, instead of calling for the data at the User's discretion. Users need no interaction with the database, aside from viewing, so no functionality exists at this time that allows Users to change the stored data. From the display, Users should be able to view, filter, and select any parcel machine to be viewed online or exported in excel format.
